If you read this, I consider that you know the coding exercise which led me to build this app.

Since the use of NodeJS was mandatory despite the fact that this project did not necessitate a lot of backend (considering the provided API), I decided to make the most out of it and to process the data in the backend. It might not be particularly relevant for a small database like this one, but for a bigger one it could greatly decrease the amount of information sent from the backend to the frontend.

I also chose not to use a frontend framework like Angular because it would have been overkill in my opinion.

Thank you for reading.
